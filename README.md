This is a ASP.NET Core backend development practice project - a simple Todo application which allows users to sign up, manage their accounts and perform CRUD operations on their todos.

I've created this project in order to practice the following aspects of ASP.NET Core backend development:

- Implementing Clean Architecture solution structure
- Implementing CQRS
- Implementing the Mediator pattern (using MediatR library)
- Adding JWT-token user authentication and authorization
- Using ASP.NET Core's built-in caching and rate-limiting functionality
- Adding healthchecks to the API
- Creating unit tests
- Using logging with Serilog
- Validating data with FluentValidation
- Using Dapper and Postgresql to handle data persistence
